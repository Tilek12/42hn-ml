# 42HN x appliedAI: Machine Learning & MLOps

Welcome to the Machine Learning & Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Assignments repository for students of 42 Heilbronn! This repository contains hands-on assignments across three key areas of machine learning. These assignments are designed to build practical skills in both ML and MLOps.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/aai-institute/42hn-ml/blob/main/part-1.md) let's you dive into regression tasks and learn how to track experiments effectively.
- Part 2 introduces classification models and you will deploy your trained models via a serving API.
- Part 3 focuses on pipeline orchestration, where you'll automate and manage end-to-end ML workflows.
